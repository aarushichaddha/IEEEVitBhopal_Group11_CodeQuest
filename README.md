Project Description : Our project focuses on developing a comprehensive system for monitoring and promoting environmental sustainability. By leveraging advanced technologies, we aim to provide real-time data and actionable insights to help communities and organizations reduce their environmental impact. The system will track various environmental parameters such as air quality, water quality, and energy consumption, and provide recommendations for improvement.
Technologies Used :  
	Frontend :- Html, css, javascript
	Backend :- node js, express js
	Database :- MongoDB
Setup Instructions :
		Prerequisites :
			1. Node.js :- Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
			2. MongoDB :- Install MongoDB to manage your database.
			3. Code Editor :- Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code for development.
		Steps : 
			1. Create Project Directory :- Set up a directory structure for your project with separate folders for the frontend and backend.
			2. Initialize Node.js Project :- Initialize a Node.js project to manage dependencies.
			3. Install Dependencies :- Install necessary backend packages such as Express.js, Mongoose, Body-Parser, and CORS.
			4. Create Server Files :- Set up a basic Express server that connects to MongoDB, handles middleware, and routes API requests.
			5. Define Mongoose Model :- Create Mongoose schemas to define the structure of your data.
			6. Set Up API Routes :- Create routes to handle API requests for CRUD operations on your data.
			7. Create Frontend Files :- Develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend interface. This includes an HTML file for the structure, a CSS file for 				   styling, and a JavaScript file to interact with the backend API.
			8. Connect Frontend to Backend :- Use fetch or AJAX to send requests from the frontend to the backend API and dynamically update the frontend based on                 responses.
			9. Run the Server :- Start your Express server to handle requests and serve data.
			10.Test the Application :- Open your frontend HTML file in a browser to interact with the full-stack application, ensuring that data can be added, retrieved,          and displayed correctly.
